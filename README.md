*Docker: is used for the purpose of contanerization purpose. "docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 kurento/kurento-media-server:latest"  pasting this line on the terminal will run the Kurento Server for online web camera streaming.

The application provides a smooth user experience where users can browse available camera equipment, check time slot availability, and book their preferred camera setup for a specific time. The system also allows users to view and manage their past and upcoming bookings.
The frontend of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a responsive and user-friendly interface.
The backend is powered by Java, with Spring Boot used to build robust RESTful APIs and manage business logic efficiently. Hibernate is used as the ORM tool to map Java classes to the relational database and simplify data operations. The application connects to a MySQL database that stores user data, camera inventory, and booking details.
To make deployment easier and more consistent, the entire project is containerized using Docker. This ensures that the application runs reliably across different environments without the need for manual setup.

Cam Reserve includes features like user registration, login, booking validation, and an admin dashboard for managing camera inventory and booking schedules. It follows the MVC architecture and uses secure coding practices for authentication and data handling.
This project reflects the implementation of real-world full-stack development skills using modern web technologies and frameworks. It showcases an end-to-end booking workflow integrated with database management and containerization, making it both functional and scalable.

Technologies used: Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Docker
